## Raising a PR

- Before raising a PR, you need to run prettier (`npm run format`), then add all files to your commit
- PR builds needs to be approved in percy (https://percy.io) if they contain any changes under the src dir (performance data update does not require percy approval)

## Running Locally

- `bundle install` to install middleman and its dependencies
- `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies
- `bundle exec middleman server` - to start middleman's built in server
- `open http://localhost:4567` - to open the example in your browser

## Building a Static Copy of the Site

- `bundle install`
- `npm install`
- `bundle exec middleman build`

Check the `build` directory for the output.

## Releasing a Static Copy of the Site

Releases are created when changes are merged into the `main` branch.

The product pages are then deployed to GitHub Pages automatically via GitHub Actions. Page contents are cached for roughly 30 minutes so your changes might not be viewable immediately.
