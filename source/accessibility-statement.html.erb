      <p class="govuk-body">We’re committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non accessible content</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">For paying users:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>error messages and labels for card expiry dates may not be announced to screen readers (WCAG success criterion 4.1.3)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">We intend to fix these problems by 31 December 2020.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Users in government service teams will find that checkboxes for applying settings to a service need to be tabbed through to select and deselect. We’re intending to diagnose and fix this issue by 31 December 2020.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Additionally the following content on <a class="govuk-link" href="https://payments.statuspage.io/">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay’s status page</a> is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard. The non-compliances are listed below:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>‘Subscribe to updates’ link does not contain programmatically discernible link text (WCAG success criterion 1.3.1)</li>
        <li>‘Subscribe to updates’ form fields do not contain an explicit label (WCAG success criterion 1.3.1)<li>
        <li>‘Subscribe to updates’ forms do not indicate to users that they are expandable or collapsible (WCAG success criterion 4.1.2)</li>
        <li>‘Subscribe to updates’ forms, when submitted with incorrect data, do not inform screen reader users of the error message when it becomes available (WCAG success criterion 4.1.3)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We are working with the supplier of <a class="govuk-link" href="https://payments.statuspage.io/">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay’s status page</a> who intend to make their service fully accessible but they have not yet provided a fixed date for this. We will, however, make an assessment when the contract is up for renewal.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The service was last tested on 6 August 2020 and was checked for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA. The test was carried out by the Digital Accessibility Centre.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You can contact us on <a class="govuk-link" href="mailto:govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">govuk-pay-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a> to receive a copy of the full accessibility audit report.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We tested user journeys for both paying users and government service teams, including:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>setting up a test account</li>
        <li>making a demo payment</li>
        <li>setting up a payment link</li>
        <li>requesting a live account</li>
        <li>adding a team member</li>
        <li>creating a prototype link</li>
        <li>logging in to an account</li>
        <li>making a card payment</li>
        <li>making a card payment with Apple Pay and Google Pay</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We previously tested this service for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA on 5 September 2019.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our <a class="govuk-link" href="/roadmap/">roadmap</a> includes information about how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We know that if you take too long to submit information on a form, you will not receive a warning message or be able to extend your time. This is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AAA standard, section 2.2.6.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We conducted an accessibility review in 2016 and found that setting a 90-minute timeout was more helpful for users with accessibility needs than a warning message. If we plan to do more research on this, it will be announced in our roadmap.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This page was prepared on 10 September 2019. It was last updated on 6 November 2020.</p>
