        <p class="govuk-body">
          You cannot use autocomplete to populate the country field on our payment pages. This is to ensure that the country used is from the GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay validated dataset.
          Most users will not be affected, as the United Kingdom is the default value.

        <p class="govuk-body">We tested user journeys for both paying users and government service teams, including:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>setting up a test account</li>
          <li>making a demo payment</li>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Our <%= link_to 'roadmap', 'roadmap', class: 'govuk-link' %> includes information about how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this service.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We know that if you take too long to submit information on a form, you will not receive a warning message or be able to extend your time. This is not compliant with the
          Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AAA standard, section 2.2.6.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We conducted an accessibility review in 2016 and found that setting a 90-minute timeout was more helpful for users with accessibility needs than a warning message. If we
          plan to do more research on this, it will be announced in our roadmap.
