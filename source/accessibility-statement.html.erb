          This service is partially compliant with the
          <%= link_to 'Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard', 'https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21', class: 'govuk-link' %>, due to the non-compliances listed

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          You cannot use autocomplete to populate the country field on our payment pages. This is to ensure that the country used is from the GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay validated dataset.
          Most users will not be affected, as the United Kingdom is the default value.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          There is a 90-minute timeout on payment pages and you cannot extend your time. We do not display a message to users because this might be inaccurate due to timeouts
          imposed by third-party providers. This is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AAA standard, section 2.2.6.
