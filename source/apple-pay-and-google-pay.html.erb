        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How Apple Pay and Google Pay work</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Any user with Apple Pay or Google Pay enabled can make payments on your service in seconds.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Because Apple Pay and Google already have users’ details, they do not have to fill them in again on GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay. They just have to:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>click pay</li>
          <li>check their details which have been automatically completed</li>
          <li>confirm payment</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The entire process takes users seconds.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits of Apple Pay and Google Pay</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">Using Apple Pay or Google Pay:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            is a more secure way to pay - users’ real card details are never stored or transferred and they can authorise payment biometrically using fingerprint or facial
            recognition
          </li>
          <li>makes it quicker - the whole process takes a few seconds</li>
          <li>makes paying easier - there are no forms to fill in as the user’s information is repeated by Apple Pay or Google Pay before users commit to the payment</li>
          <li>reduces errors - users do not have to retype any of their details</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Using Apple Pay means you do not have to go through 3DS or 3DS2 authentication because that security is built-in. This makes it more secure for services to take payment
          as a user cannot create a chargeback (for fraud) on a payment.
