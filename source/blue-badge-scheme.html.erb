        <p class="govuk-body">Local authorities can no longer use the Blue Badge Improvement Service for Blue Badge payments.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The Department for Transport (DfT) has recommended local authorities use
          <a class="govuk-link" href="/">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay</a> to take and process online payments for Blue Badges.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay is a free and secure online payment service for government and public sector organisations.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay provides customer-facing pages to take card payment details from users and the back-end system to process and view transactions. We use a payment service
          provider to take the money out of the user’s account and deposit it into your account.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment service provider</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay has procured a payment service provider (PSP) to take and process payments. This allows you to use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay without a separate contract for a
          payment gateway.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll just need to provide:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your organisation’s bank account</li>
          <li>your organisation’s address</li>
          <li>the details of a nominated person from your organisation so we can run some security checks</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Using our PSP means:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the process is very simple</li>
          <li>it’s very quick - your GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay account and PSP account will be set up within a working day and you can start taking payments immediately</li>
          <li>you’re not locked into a long-term contract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contract</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You’ll need to sign a contract with GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay before you can take payments. If you choose to use our PSP, you’ll need to sign the Connected PSP Account Agreement
          too.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once the contracts are signed, you can also use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay to take payments for other services you provide.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          In order to download and review the contracts, you’ll need to
          <%= link_to 'either sign in or sign up for a test GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay account', 'https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login', class: 'govuk-link' %>.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once you have an account, and you are logged in, you can download the:</p>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The contracts are linked from the page footer.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we set up the contract</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The contract we have in place with our PSP is a direct award on the
          <%=
            link_to 'Crown Commercial Service\'s Merchant Acquiring Services, Equipment and Payment Gateway Services',
                    'https://ccs-agreements.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/contracts/rm3702',
                    class: 'govuk-link'
          %>
          framework. That framework follows all the applicable OJEU rules and processes.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We chose direct award because Stripe was the only supplier who could meet our requirements. The contract was approved by the Commercial Director of Cabinet Office.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Transaction charges using our PSP</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">There are no account creation or management fees, and you do not need a separate merchant acquirer contract.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The transaction fees are in the GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay contract. You’ll find our fees structure on page 36 in Schedule 6: Fees. For card payments you’ll get ‘Option 1 Blended
          rate card fees’.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If a transaction is refunded you receive the variable (%) transaction amount back, but not the fixed cost.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Receiving payments using our PSP</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay processes debit and credit card transactions.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">All payments will be sent to the bank account you specify when you set up your GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay account.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Payments are processed instantly. You’ll be able to see payment information in real-time on your dashboard. They’re paid into your account in batches 2 working days after
          the payment is made. Every payment is assigned a unique application ID. Transaction charges are withdrawn against your connected PSP account monthly.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay can’t process cash, cheque or automated phone payments.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay and the Blue Badge service</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          DfT and their supplier are integrating GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay into the Blue Badge service. They are also building the integration that takes payment confirmation data from
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay into the Manage Blue Badge application.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          To take payments at the time of application, you'll just need to share the live API key for your service with DfT and their supplier using the process described in
          communications with you.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you want to automate your reporting or refunds process, you’ll need to integrate the service with your income and case management systems.</p>
