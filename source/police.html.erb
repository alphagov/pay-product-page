        <p class="govuk-body">
          The government is creating a template website and backend system for all UK police forces to use. It’s called the Single Online Home (SOH). The SOH will allow the public
          to access police services across the UK in a consistent way.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">As part of this, all police forces will use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay to take online payments for their services, starting with firearm licences.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay is a free and secure online payment service for government and public sector organisations.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay provides customer-facing pages to take card payment details from users and the back-end system to process and view transactions. We use a payment service
          provider (PSP) to take the money out of the user’s account and deposit it into your account.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          We comply with the <%= link_to 'Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)', 'security', class: 'govuk-link' %>. You can also access our privacy policy from
          your account.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment service providers (PSPs)</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay has procured a payment service provider (PSP) to take and process payments. This allows you to use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay without a separate payment gateway.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">You’ll just need to provide:</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your organisation’s bank account</li>
          <li>your organisation’s address</li>
          <li>the details of a nominated person from your organisation so we can run some security checks</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-heading-s">Using our PSP means:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the process is very simple</li>
          <li>it’s very quick - your GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay account and PSP account will be set up within a working day and you can start taking payments immediately</li>
          <li>you’re not locked into a long-term contract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contract</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You’ll need to sign a contract with GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay before you can take payments. If you choose to use our PSP, you’ll need to sign the Connected PSP Account Agreement
          too.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Once the contracts are signed, you can also use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay to take payments for other services you provide.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          In order to download and review the contracts, you’ll need to
          <%= link_to 'either sign in or sign up for a test GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay account', 'https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login', class: 'govuk-link' %>.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Once you are signed in to your account you can download the:</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Payment reference number</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The Single Online Home system will generate an application reference number to associate with the payment. This will enable you to reconcile the application with the
          payment.
