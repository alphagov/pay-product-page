          The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requires Stripe (GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay's payment service provider) to carry out anti-money laundering checks. These are part of the Know
          Your Customer (KYC) regulations.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          To comply with the regulations, you'll need to add personal information about specific individuals in your organisation. Stripe will store this information, not
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay.
