        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay is independently tested</h2>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data handling</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We only collect the data necessary to run GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          We will not retain that data any longer than we need it, and definitely no longer than 7 years, and only share it if it’s necessary to run GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay or if required by
          law.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay is the data processor and your service is the data controller. The data protection/data processing agreement is in schedule 4 of the memorandum of
          understanding and schedule 5 of the contract.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Liability</h2>

          For instance, you can block users from using prepaid cards to make payments. Or, Worldpay users can set their account to refuse a transaction if IP address isn’t
          provided. This is particularly useful if your service has a higher risk profile.
