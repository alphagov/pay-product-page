        <p class="govuk-body">
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay is a free service, available to public sector organisations to take online card payments. There’s no monthly charge, no set-up fee and no procurement
          process. It enables service teams to replace offline payment methods quickly and easily, providing a Payment Card Industry (PCI) fully compliant, secure and accessible
          user experience hosted on GOV.UK.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">

          <a class="govuk-link" href="https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/register/email-address">create an account</a>
          and you can take payments within a day using our
          <%= link_to 'payment link functionality', 'govuk-payment-pages', class: 'govuk-link' %>
          but many services opt for a richer experience and integrate with our well-documented API.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">With GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay you can:</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Most public sector organisations can use Pay, for example:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>central government departments</li>
          <li>local authorities</li>
          <li>armed forces</li>
          <li>NHS, including NHS trusts</li>
          <li>emergency services</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          However, public sector organisations are not allowed to use GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay for commercial ‘intended for profit’ purposes. If your organisation is an 'enterprise' as
          described in the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/23/enacted">Subsidy Control Act 2022</a> you will not be able to use
          GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Payment Service Provider</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          You need a Payment Service Provider (PSP) to process payments through GOV.UK&nbsp;Pay. We’ve already procured Stripe as our payment provider for you if you work for a
          local authority, police force or a government-owned charitable group.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Alternatively, if you are a central government or health sector organisation, you can use Government Banking’s centralised contract currently held with Worldpay.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          When these contracts and/or suppliers change we will handle the technical integration and make the switch as seamless as possible for public sector users.
